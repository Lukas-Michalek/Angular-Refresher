<!-- *1*  42. Outputting a Dynamically Rendered List Content -->

<!-- # To render list dynamicaly I need to use a special Angular syntax -> @for loop with tracking mechanism ===> @for (item of items; track $index) -->

<!-- + From above note that 'item' is a word up to me and 'items' is the name of that specific list I will go through (DUMMY_USERS that are stored in variable 'users'). The last part I would need is a way to track these items and it has to be something they have unique .... in this case it is user ID -->
<app-header />

<main>
  <ul id="users">

    @for ( user of users; track user.id) {
    <li>
      <app-user
        [user]="user"
        (select)="onSelectUser($event)"
      />
    </li>
    }

  </ul>

  <app-tasks [name]="selectedUserName ? selectedUserName.name : ''">

    <!--* If the selectedUserName is defined use the value  selectedUserName.name and if it is undefined use undefined as a fallback value-->

    <!-- - [name]="selectedUserName?.name" is the same as [name]="selectedUserName ? selectedUser.name : ''"-->

    <!-- - <app-tasks [name]="selectedUserName.name"> -->
